# DESCRIPTION
#   Bundles the Windows executable into an installer using InnoSetup.
#   Although this is a bash script, it expects to be run in a Windows environment.
#   It has been written in bash out of convenience, since CircleCI supports it.
#
# Note: this script uses relative paths, so it's meant to be run from within the bin folder.
